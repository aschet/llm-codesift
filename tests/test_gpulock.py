"""The lock that stops two jobs loading models onto one card at once.

The Windows half of it cannot be reached from the platform it is developed on,
so it is exercised here with the locking primitive stood in for. What that
catches is the half that is ours: which file is opened, that a cascade may take
the lock it already holds, and that the path is one Windows can name.

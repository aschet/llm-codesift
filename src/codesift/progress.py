"""Everything the stages print, as TAP version 14.

https://testanything.org/tap-version-14-specification.html

Every stage reports the same thing -- a model, the units of work done to it, and
how each one came out -- which is what TAP describes, so every stage prints it as
TAP and nothing prints any other way.

    TAP version 14
    # Subtest: triage
        # Subtest: gemma4:e4b
            ok 1 - triage speed
              ---
              duration_s: 11.8
              detail: "generates 115 tok/s"
              ...
            not ok 2 - triage context
              ---
              duration_s: 88.1
              detail: "dropped part of the prompt at its 32k window"
              ...
            1..2
        not ok 1 - gemma4:e4b
          ---
          result: "rejected at context, 100s"
          ...
        1..1
    not ok 1 - triage
    1..1

Points where the specification decides the shape:

Plans trail their test points. The spec allows either position, and a gate
cascade stops at the first failure, so how many test points a model will produce
is not known when its subtest opens.

A subtest opens only when its first test point arrives. A model already on record
produces no test points -- there is nothing to measure -- so it is written as a
plain test point carrying its stored verdict rather than as an empty subtest.

A commented subtest "must be terminated by a Test Point with a matching
Description", so the parent point repeats the subtest name exactly and carries
nothing else in its description.

The parent point fails when any point inside it failed. Consumers assume that,
and a passing parent over a failing child is the one thing a TAP reader cannot
make sense of.

Diagnostics go in the YAML block, never in the directive slot. The first
unescaped `#` after a description opens a directive, and only TODO and SKIP are
directives, so a duration parked there is not valid TAP. Descriptions escape any
`#` they contain for the same reason.

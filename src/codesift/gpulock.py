"""Mutual exclusion for anything that loads a model.

Two jobs sharing one GPU thrash and silently corrupt each other's timings, so
every stage takes this lock first. fcntl is used on POSIX and msvcrt on Windows;
both provide an advisory exclusive lock released when the process exits.

The lock is per endpoint, so runs against different servers do not block each
other. It is local to one machine: several machines driving the same remote
server cannot observe each other's lock.
